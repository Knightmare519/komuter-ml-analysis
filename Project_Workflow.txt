# WIA1006 Machine Learning Assignment 

## Project Workflow Overview

### 1. Problem Understanding
- Define the specific problem to be solved
- Identify the business context and importance
- Set clear objectives and success metrics
- Determine if this is a classification, regression, clustering, or other type of ML problem
- Research existing solutions and approaches

### 2. Data Collection
- Identify required data sources (datasets, APIs, web scraping, etc.)
- Consider data volume requirements
- Ensure data relevance to the problem
- Verify data quality and accessibility
- Document data sources and collection methods

### 3. Data Exploration & Preprocessing
- Perform exploratory data analysis (EDA)
  - Statistical summaries
  - Distribution analysis
  - Feature correlations
  - Missing value assessment
- Data cleaning
  - Handle missing values
  - Remove duplicates
  - Fix inconsistencies
  - Outlier detection and treatment
- Feature engineering
  - Create new features
  - Transform existing features
  - Encode categorical variables
  - Scale/normalize numerical features
- Data splitting (training, validation, testing)

### 4. Model Building
- Select appropriate algorithms based on problem type
- Implement baseline models
- Tune hyperparameters using:
  - Grid search
  - Random search
  - Bayesian optimization
- Implement more complex models as needed
- Ensemble methods if appropriate

### 5. Model Evaluation
- Define appropriate evaluation metrics
  - Classification: accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, AUC-ROC, etc.
  - Regression: MAE, MSE, RMSE, RÂ², etc.
  - Clustering: silhouette score, Davies-Bouldin index, etc.
- Validate models using:
  - Cross-validation
  - Holdout validation
- Compare model performance
- Analyze errors and edge cases

### 6. Model Interpretation & Insights
